A C#.net Client to the Geoserver 2.1.x+ RESTful configuration extension. Using this library, one can access a remote Geoserver via HTTP and configure it.

The REST extension of Geoserver has to be installed on Geoserver.

This project uses .net framework 4.0 and has no extra dependencies!

This is a conversion from the http://code.google.com/p/gsrcj/, which is a Java Api. Since there was no C# .net API for accessing the REST Api for Geoserver.

The first version aims to implement the same thing in the java version, and latter to implement the full rest api.
